# React-Native_testApp
watch demo https://expo.io/@denys_dvl/firstProject or run `expo start` in the terminal and scan the QR-code.<br>
There may be a problem with using it on Android (not tested)<br>
Also, to use the app you need to have a key to the api you can get it here [https://exchangeratesapi.io/](https://exchangeratesapi.io/).<br>
Once you have the key insert it into the variable "__apiKey" in httpService.js.<br>
With a free subscription you will only be able to change the date and change the time interval <br>
